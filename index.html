              It is with great pleasure that I write this letter of recommendation for 
              Shari Frachiseur/Sugar & Spice Catering. I have known Mrs. Frachiseur for 
              several years and when a friend of mine approached me to host a formal dinner 
              for our daughter’s Homecoming event she was the first person who came to mind. 
              The dinner was a complete success with forty-seven guests in attendance. 
            </h5>
            <h5 class="modal-review-content">
              Ms. Frachiseur had a beautiful table set up with a large variety of desserts. We served a large 
              chocolate cake, cookies, chocolate covered strawberries, lemon bars, and blonde 
              brownies. Not only were the desserts delicious, but the table was beautiful too. 
              Her dedication to quality customer service was bar none. I had forgotten to 
              bring a few items I needed to set up the rest of the dinner and Ms. Frachiseur 
              went out of her to help me out. 
            </h5>
            <h5 class="modal-review-content">
              I can confidently recommend Ms. Frachiseur for any 
              banquet, reception or other event you may be planning. She will get the job 
              done with elegance, the food will be delightful, and the prices are unbeatable.

              My daughter Megan was married in April 2009. We had a church wedding with a reception following 
              at our home. Shari came early that morning and began preparing the food as we were getting 
              ready to leave for the church. She was very prepared, bringing a lot of her own supplies, 
              and also very organized. I left for the church without any worries. 
            </h5>
            <h5 class="modal-review-content">
              When we returned from the wedding, everything was ready and looked beautiful. There was a variety of 
              food that was displayed very creatively. The food not only looked great, but it tasted even better! 
              The guests made comments all afternoon about how good everything looked and tasted. Some even wanted 
              her name for future reference. I was extremely pleased and so relieved that I did not have to worry 
              about that aspect of the wedding. 
            </h5>  
            <h5 class="modal-review-content">
              Shari has also prepared food for our staff luncheons and breakfasts at our school. 
              The presentation of the food has always been very inviting and always very delicious. 
              Teachers love to eat, so we are always excited to know when Shari has prepared the food.
            </h5>
            <h5 class="modal-review-content">
              I would recommend Shari to prepare the food for any function. She is very organized, professional, 
              easy to work with, and her prices are very reasonable. I would definitely use her services again 
              in the future.

              My oldest son, Kevin, was getting married, and I needed to find a caterer for the rehearsal dinner.
              I had no idea where to begin, but after finding Shari Frachiseur, my worries faded away. 
            </h5>
            <h5 class="modal-review-content">
              When the rehearsal dinner arrived, the entire evening could not have been more perfect. Kevin and his 
              bride wanted fajitas, so Shari planned the menu around their request. We all enjoyed a bountiful 
              dish of fajitas, rice and beans, amazing homemade salsa, brownies, chocolate covered strawberries 
              and several other dessert choices. 
            </h5>
            <h5 class="modal-review-content">
              From the beginning, Shari was a delight to work with, and the guests raved about how delicious the 
              food was. The evening was stress-free for me and my husband as Shari took care of everything! She was 
              extremely well prepared and organized. Shari has lovely serving pieces, so not only was the food wonderful, 
              but the presentation was also very impressive. I have two other sons and a daughter, so I look forward 
              to many more catering opportunities with Shari. The food, the value, and the service simply cannot be beaten – anywhere.

              used for our fundraisers this year. I have attended many catered events that she has done for our 
              school as well. The presentation and food were all exceptional. The display of the food was very 
              attractive and appealing. The simple finger foods to the full course meals have all been enjoyable

              Spice Catering will make your event successful, no matter how small or large. Her help is always 
              courteous and helpful. Her hardworking positive attitude will motivate her in all she attempts in life.

              Sugar & Spice Catering provides excellent service and food. Shari's a great communicator 
              and very easy to work with from the first consultation to the end of the wedding.  
              She catered my daughter's wedding yesterday and we had twice the number of people we had 
              planned for. Shari had more than enough food and never appeared flustered. She and her 
              assistants were very professional and even made sure the kitchen at the church was spotless 
              before they left. Shari also works very hard to make sure she keeps the cost down.  
              I would highly recommend Sugar & Spice Catering and would gladly use them again.</h5>

              Shari with Sugar & Spice Catering knows her business! I came to her months in advanced 
              with a major wishlist and through her expert guidance and cost-saving suggestions she 
              made it happen for my wedding day. Shari stayed in constant contact with me to discuss details, 
              alternatives and offered sound advice. All are must-haves when planning your own wedding.

              Every guest (including that one aunt you just can't please) complimented 
              the food, the presentation, and the service that Sugar & Spice Catering provided. 
              I could not have wished for better service, no matter the price&mdash;and she was very affordable.  
              I would recommend her to anyone without hesitation. If you are considering a catered affair, 
              she is the one to call.
