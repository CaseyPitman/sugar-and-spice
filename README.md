HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, & jQuery

This is my first freelance project. It's a multi-page site for a local caterer that includes a landing page, a menu, an image gallery, and a contact form. I learned so much on this project, not the least of which was how to manage my time and how to work closely with a client to produce a site that meets their needs and specifications. This was also my first full-scale implementation of Bootstrap.
