## Notes

- This was a huge learning experience. It was my first time to balance technological considerations with client needs and expectations. Communication with my client was vital to the success of this project, and near daily discussions helped ensure the creation of a product the client was happy with. 

- This was my one of my first implementations of [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/). I used it fairly extensively, but found I still desired quite a bit of customization. I decided to go with [SASS](https://sass-lang.com/) for my custom CSS for the simple reason I hadn't used it before and wanted to gain the experience.  
  
  I appreciate some of the Bootstrap built-in features, but I still desire a finer amount of control over styles. As such, I now tend to gravitate toward custom CSS throughout my projects. 

- I used just enough jQuery to collapse the navbar after user selection in mobile viewports. I had just begun learning JavaScript when working on this project, and React was still months away. 

- While this wasn't the first project in which I'd had to build a form, it was the first in which I'd had to deal with form submission. I hadn't learned enough JavaScript or Node.js yet to be able to handle this myself. I found [Formspree](https://formspree.io/), a service that collects form submissions and emails them to a predetermined email address (in this case, my client).
